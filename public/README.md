# Public Directory

This directory is used by Next.js for static assets.

## Usage

Place static files here:
- Images (logos, icons, etc.)
- Fonts
- `favicon.ico`
- `robots.txt`
- Any other static assets

Files in this directory are served at the root path `/`.

Example:
- `public/logo.png` → accessible at `/logo.png`
- `public/images/hero.jpg` → accessible at `/images/hero.jpg`
